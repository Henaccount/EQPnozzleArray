# EQPnozzleArray - Plant 3D Example Code - Use at own risk

Note: better approach can be found here (NozzleArray).



Speed up (a bit) the nozzle creation workflow, if there are many nozzles on an equipment.
You can prepare lines for the nozzle direction and length. Make sure the lines intersect with the equipment.
<li>Compile this code with Visual Studio and load the resulting dll with "netload".
<li>Execute the EQPnozzleArray command from the command line.
<li>You will be prompted to select the equipment.
<li>You will be prompted to select a line.
<li>You need to specify the nozzle type, unfortunately the nozzle type window does not remember the nozzle type.
<li>Click "close", then you will be prompted for the next line.
<li>In order to end the command, select a last, random line and then press "esc" button, the last nozzle will disappear.
